		<p>Merry Christmas and Happy 2017! We've got a lot of fun in front of us. Lot's of things to look forward to. I can't wait to celelbrate 2017 with you - and look forward to our 2018, of course - while we enjoy this Winter Break. There are SO many things to be thankful for and to think about. Think of this little love site as a fun way for us to re-cap our 2017 and look forward to 2018 :)</p>
	<p>This'll be a little photo journey + jQuery / HTML / CSS project for your love bug. It's fun showing you love in many different techy ways. Hold on to your hat and get ready for the ride!</p>
	<p>Are you ready? Let's go!</p>

	<p>We started our new year in Charlotte at Matt and Tam's, remember the fun? You took this photo of Matt and I choppin' wood and making a fire - doing man things. I remember buying a bow and arrow set and shooting things in Matt's backyard. I remember buying a bag of birdseed and spreading it all over the backyard and hoping that tons of birds came to nom, nom, nom.</p>

	<p>Remember going to Seattle with Ray-Ray? Of course you do! Salmon Sam and Ray Ray August toured the town and went to cool places like the Space Needle. You took this super-cool pic there and I liked it on instagram.</p>

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/lF7kC4N.jpg" width="100%" height="100%">
	<p>Staying with Martha for much of 2016 taught me how to handle being uncomfortable and creating comfort in new places. We got used to staying with other people and learning to smile in places we might not have smiled. We're introverts in an extrovert world and you and I are always finding our little love bubbles to enjoy our smiles together.</p>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/OgLrVWa.jpg" width="100%" height="100%">
	<p>You went to COSTA RICA in February and did fun things like this zipline. Hey! You're upside down you silly goose XP</p>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/zhiaqZp.jpg" height="100%" width="100%">
	<p>At a certain point you gotta go home and work! "Oh darn, gotta go work on my beer company and do terribly un-fun things like taste beer."</p>

	<h2 id="march">March</h2>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Oa5MnjW.png" height="100%" width="100%">
	<p>March came, and you were in San Francisco. I in Charlotte. You take such cool photos, Sami. I could look through your instagram feed forever!</p>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/EMn8baP.jpg" height="100%" width="100%">
	<p>We were apart and you were missing your man when you posted this. It was really tough being so far apart from each other for so long. You took this photo back in 2016 when you and I were vising Nik and Colbs in Greenville; remembering times when we were together....</p>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/d3CeBqd.jpg" width="100%" height="100%">
	<p>Meanwhile, I was in Charlotte derping arounbd and around and around. I started sketching a lot because, well, I didn't have anything else to do! Where was my handful?</p>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/tW5Mfwu.jpg" width="100%" height="100%">
	<p>I remember thinking about how much fun you and I were going to have in this apartment. At that time I had no idea that we would be staying out West! I was nesting in Charlotte and missing you.</p>


	<h2>April</h2>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/jsdwz7U.jpg" height="100%" width="100%">
	<p>In April I took lots of photos of beer because, well, what else did I have to do! I hung out with Brandon a lot, and drank a lot of beer.</p>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/qftcC9o.png" height="100%" width="100%">
	<p>You spent time at Half Moon Bay. And I spent time being jealous of you! Now we are in California together, and will be planning many trips to the North, South, West and East of ourselves here on Folsom Street.</p>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/yULeKmT.png" height="100%" width="100%">
	<p>Finally you came to visit me and your Charlotte team.</p>


	<h2>May</h2>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/pS5yzgf.jpg" width="100%" height="100%">
	<p>In May, you went to MEHICO! As I'm writing this love letter, you and I and Charlie and preparing to go to Mehico, too! Hola Mehico! We are coming for you. I'm excited to travel with you, Sami. We have not just Mexico, but also SF, and Hawaii, and Austrailia, and New Zealand! Wowzers. And then back to a city we both LOVE and then on to who-knows-where. Maybe we'll visit Lake Tahoe, or go visit Matt and Tam in Colorado, or go North to Canada or Seattle or Portland or something. So much fun to be had.</p>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/wOHoEe0.jpg" width="100%" height="100%">
	<p>Lot's of fun was had in Puerto Vallerta.</p>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/MHRaJ9F.jpg" width="100%" height="100%">
	<p>And another thing happened... Alex GRADUATED! Good job, big Sis. One more to go :)</p>


	<h2>June</h2>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/EEMZtLe.jpg" width="100%" height="100%">
	<p>We celebrated 7 years on June 2nd. Do you remember where and what we ate?!</p>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/wai9mE8.jpg" width="100%" height="100%">
	<p>We flew back East and went to a wedding! Chas and Margie got married and we danced our faces off and hung out with all of your USC Tennis Friends. That was a fun night, wasn't it? We stayed at Tori's place and then rented a big ol truck and drove North to Charlotte.</p>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/BlANF7r.png" height="100%" width="100%">
	<p>We traveled South to Charleston and spent some time with your family. Lewis' BBQ was FOR SURE on the agenda...</p>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/qWYlrTb.jpg" height="100%" width="100%">
	<p>Your families home is so beautiful and you are so clever with a camera. Beautiful pic of a beautiful place.</p>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/vg0oba5.jpg" height="100%" width="100%">
	<p>We spent a weekend in the Georgia Mountains with my family celebrating Bryan's Week. Puzzles and back porch views.</p>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/MxIIuDK.jpg" height="100%" width="100%">


	<h2>July</h2>
	<p>A gorgeous photo from Wework, a client YOU won us. I'm always impressed with your business ability. You can do it all, really. Sam for all the C-Suite!</p>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/R7PaNAv.jpg" height="100%" width="100%">
	<p>You went to Yosemite! And on this day, July 9th, 2017, you started day dreaming about when you and I would go cmaping in Yosemite. And we will! And it will be blissful. You were also getting TONS of likes about this time. See that like number???? TONS!</p>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/byEM9ej.jpg" height="100%" width="100%">
	<p>A beautiful pic of SF. I can't help but smile at these pics of our new home :) It makes me happy to see pictures of a place that we share together...</p>


	<h2>August</h2>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/GdFlm2y.png" height="100%" width="100%">
	<p>You came home again in August in preparation for the Gamecock football season. Atleast that's what you told your fam, but I knew the real reason you were home :)</p>


	<h2>September</h2>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/GgK4lGR.jpg" height="100%" width="100%">
	<p>We spent the beginning of September in Charlotte, watching your brother play. We hosted Abe and Nat and hung out with your family. Thanks for helping me skip dangerous dinners at basic fried wing places... ew gross. We baked biscuits for Abe and Nat and Tor before they left for NJ and ATL. That was really fun :D.</p>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/53tgYJv.png" height="100%" width="100%">
	<p>You left me for SF, but that's ok because I'd soon be following you... Little did I know that it would become our new home!</p>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/T3edvQ6.png" height="100%" width="100%">
	<p>And here I am. San Francisco for my 29th birthday! Wowzeries. We went down to the Bay Bridge for this early morning sunrise. Dr. Jack Kruse used my photo in his own memes and so of course that made my day.</p>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/4crtsqN.jpg" height="100%" width="100%">
	<p>We went to the rose garden and lovey-dovied around. You posted this sweet little post of the two of us.</p>


	<h2>October</h2>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/I430sTR.jpg" height="100%" width="100%">
	<p>We found a little place for dates where the pizza is hot and the wine hits the spot; a happy place for two love birds. Motesacro Pinseria.</p>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/FJGm9u9.jpg" height="100%" width="100%">
	<p>We went to the mountains AGAIN with my family and had such a good time in this beautiful little nook in the woods. We ended up sleeping together in a little loft. Oops!</p>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/33QgOK6.jpg" height="100%" width="100%">
	<p>How could we go to the East Coast without getting a little excited about some Gamecock football. Proud sis over here! Watch out!</p>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Mt5wTdZ.jpg" height="100%" width="100%">
	<p>San Francisco welcoming you home once again :D I think it's about here where we started to get serious about a move to SF.</p>


	<h2>November</h2>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/jbCblJB.jpg" height="100%" width="100%">
	<p>We went on a day-trip North to Point Reyes and had a blast driving a drop-top mercedes benz through John Muir woods.</p>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/YMbhrsT.jpg" height="100%" width="100%">
	<p>This is the happy place. Oysters and a bestie. To be repeated in 2018!</p>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/AeCMGKf.jpg" height="100%" width="100%">
	<p>We decided to go on our World tour. A month of travel! Hawaii, here we come!</p>


	<h2>December</h2>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/nAYz9bG.png" height="100%" width="100%">
	<p>We started thinking about Mexico right about here. What a year it's been and what a vacation we deserve(d)! You've been right there with me this whole time, helping me get outside my comfort zone and experience wonderful trips like this. Thanks for talking me into a vacation, Sami :)</p>
	<p>This December we have lots to look forward to and I hope you'll join me - I know you will - in being very thankful for the journey we have ahead of us. I love you Samantha Marie August and I hope you have a very merry Christmas 2017. I'm looking forward to many more together. </p>
